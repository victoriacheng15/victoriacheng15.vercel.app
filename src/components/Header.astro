					ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I am Victoria Cheng!
				</h1>
				<p>
					As a <Highlight text="software developer" /> and <Highlight text="blogger" />, my goal is
					to make web applications as user-friendly and enjoyable as possible. With a
					customer-focused mindset and a collaborative approach, I've designed and implemented both
					the frontend and backend solutions for various web projects. My effective time management
					skills ensure that I deliver quality work within strict deadlines.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although I spent several years working as a packaging engineer, I found myself feeling
					uninspired and unfulfilled in my career. But in 2021, I decided to take the leap and dive
					into the world of programming. I've been educating myself ever since, and I'm excited to
					continue growing my skills and knowledge in this exciting field. The technology world is
					endless!
