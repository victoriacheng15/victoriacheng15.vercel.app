## WWhat are the more and less Commands in Linux?

The `more` and `less` commands are used to view the contents of text files in a paginated manner. These commands are particularly useful for reading through large files without loading the entire content into memory at once.

Basic Syntax:

By default, both commands will display the contents of the file one screen at a time.

- more:

```bash
more [option] [file]
```

- less:

```bash
less [option] [file]
```

## Options

- Options for `more`
  
| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| -d | Prompt with "[Press space to continue, 'q' to quit.]" and display "[Press 'h' for instructions.]" instead of ringing the bell |
| -c | Clear the screen before displaying the next page |
| -s | Squeeze multiple blank lines into one |
| -u | Suppress underlining |

- Options for `less`
  
| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| -N | Show line numbers |
| -S | Chop long lines instead of wrapping |
| -X | Disable termcap init/deinit codes |
| -F | Automatically exit if the entire file fits on one screen |
