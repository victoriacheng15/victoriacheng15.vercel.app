## Monthly Reflection

### Quitting…

I recently finished reading "Quit: The Power of Knowing When to Walk Away," and found it to be quite intriguing. Common advice often tells us to never stop and to always keep pushing forward. However, this book challenges that notion and offers a fresh perspective. It suggests that sometimes it’s beneficial to stop what you’re doing for several reasons. The book outlines a few key points on when it’s wise to quit:

- **Reframing Quitting**: Quitting can be strategic and positive, not just a sign of failure.
- **Decision-Making and Uncertainty**: Knowing when to quit can save time, resources, and emotional energy.
- **Opportunity Cost**: Quitting can open up opportunities that would otherwise be missed.
- **The Sunk Cost Fallacy**: Overcoming the urge to continue because of past investments is crucial.
- **Case Studies and Examples**: Examples from various fields show the benefits of strategic quitting.
- **Practical Strategies**: The book advises setting criteria for quitting and reassessing goals.
- **Mindset Shift**: Quitting should be seen as a proactive step towards success, not a failure.

After reading this book, I believe quitting is not a bad thing. It can prevent you from wasting more time and energy on unproductive efforts. Viewing quitting as a way to free yourself allows you to focus on what truly matters and better utilize your energy and time. Additionally, it's important to view things in the bigger picture; sometimes, what’s right in front of you is just the tip of the iceberg.

### Microsoft Azure

Since returning to school, I discovered some great student perks, including access to Microsoft Azure. I decided to explore what Azure has to offer, starting with the static web app service. I successfully deployed a Vue app to Azure's static web app, finding the setup process straightforward and quick. Microsoft Learn provides an excellent guide on deploying your site through either GitHub or Azure DevOps.

## Books

This month, I've been making time for reading and found two methods that work well for me: reading before sleep and after waking up. At night, reading helps me avoid phone screen time and its blue light. In the morning, it motivates me to get out of bed earlier and start my day with a good book.

- **Sleep Smarter**
    - Offers 21 essential strategies for improving sleep quality. Key tips include optimizing your sleep environment by controlling temperature and noise, managing light exposure by reducing screen time before bed, and establishing a consistent bedtime routine to enhance your overall sleep health.
- **Rich Dad Poor Dad**
    - Contrasts the financial philosophies of Robert Kiyosaki's two fathers: his biological father (Poor Dad) and his best friend's father (Rich Dad). It emphasizes financial literacy, smart investing, and entrepreneurship, highlighting the importance of acquiring assets to build wealth and achieve financial independence.
- **Designing Data-Intensive Application**
    - Explores fundamental principles for building scalable and reliable data systems. Key topics include data models and query languages, storage and retrieval strategies, data integrity and transactions, distributed systems, data processing techniques, consistency and consensus models, and security and privacy considerations.
- **Alchemy: The Surprising Power of Ideas That Don't Make Sense**
    - Explores how unconventional thinking can lead to groundbreaking innovations. Key insights include embracing ideas that initially seem illogical or impractical, leveraging randomness and unpredictability as sources of creativity, and focusing on original, unconventional solutions to solve complex problems. The book emphasizes the value of thinking differently and challenging traditional norms to achieve remarkable success.
- **The First 20 Hours: How to Learn Anything . . . Fast**
    - Explores rapid skill acquisition techniques to learn new skills efficiently. Key insights include breaking skills into manageable sub-skills, practicing in focused intervals, and emphasizing deliberate practice. The book demonstrates how dedicating just 20 hours can yield significant progress, challenging the myth that mastery requires extensive time. It emphasizes structured practice and persistence to achieve proficiency quickly.
