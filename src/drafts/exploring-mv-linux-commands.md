## What is the mv Command in Linux?

The `mv` command stands for *move*. At its core, `mv` does what its name suggests: it relocats files or directories from one location to another. However, its utility extends far beyond mere relocation, it can do reorganizing, renaming and even merging data within the file system.

## Basic syntax

```bash
mv [options] [source] [destination]
```

Rename a file or directory:

```bash
mv file.txt new-file-name.txt
# or 
mv directory new-directory-name
```

Move a file or directory:

```bash
mv file.txt directory/
```

Rename a file and move to a directory:

```bash
mv file.txt diectory/new-file-name.txt
```

### Options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| -i, --interactive | Prompts before overwriting existing files. |
| -f, --force | Overrides any existing files at the destination without prompting for confirmation. |
| -n, --no-clobber | Prevents `mv` from overwriting existing files. |
| -u, --update | Moves only when the source file is newer than the destination file or when the destination file is missing. |
| -v, --verbose | Provides detailed feedback on the actions performed by `mv`. |
| -b, --backup | Creates a backup of existing destination files. |
| -S, --suffix | Specifies the suffix to be appended to backup filenames, in conjunction with the `-b` option. |

Additionally, you can explore more by using the commands:

```bash
mv --help
# or
man mv 
```
