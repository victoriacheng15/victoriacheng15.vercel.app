## What isthe rm Command in Linux?

The `rm` command stands for remove. At its core, `rm` does what its name suggests: it deletes files or directories from the file system. However, its utility extends far beyond mere deletion; it can manage and clean up your file system efficiently, offering various options to control its behavior.

Basic syntax:

```bash
rm [option] [file]
```

Delete a file:

```bash
rm file.txt
```

Delete more than one file:

```bash
rm file1.txt file2.txt
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| -i, --interactive | Prompts before every removal. |
| -f, --force | Overrides any existing files at the destination without prompting for confirmation. |
| -r, --recursive | Removes directories and their contents recursively. |
| -d, --dir | Removes empty directories. |
| -v, --verbose | Provides detailed feedback on the actions performed by rm. |
| --preserve-root | Ensures that the root directory / is not accidentally removed. |
| --one-file-system | Limits the removal to the current file system, avoiding crossing file system boundaries. |
