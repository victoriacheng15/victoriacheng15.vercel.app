## Recap

From this book, I gained insights into the distinction between programming and software engineering. While programming is the act of producing code, software engineering encompasses the essential policies, practices, and tools that make that code viable for as long as it's needed and facilitate team collaboration.

Moreover, the book emphasizes an essential lesson: every choice requires making trade-offs. The crucial factor lies in identifying which trade-offs yield greater benefits in the long run. By asking the right questions and leveraging existing data, we can enhance our decision-making and optimize our software development processes for enduring success.
