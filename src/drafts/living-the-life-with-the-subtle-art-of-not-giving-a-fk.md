## What is The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fk?

`The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fk` by Mark Manson is a refreshingly blunt and practical guide to living an authentic and fulfilling life. With an irreverent tone, Manson challenges societal norms and offers unconventional wisdom on happiness and success. Through candid anecdotes and thought-provoking insights, he provides actionable advice on prioritizing what truly matters and letting go of the rest. 

## The Tips That I resonated with:

- Clarify your values:
    - Identify the things that truly matter to you and align them with your core values. Focus your time, energy, and attention on those areas of your life.
- Embrace uncertainty:
    - Accept that life is unpredictable and full of setbacks. Instead of trying to control everything, learn to embrace uncertainty and adapt to the challenges that come your way.
- Choose your struggles wisely:
    - Understand that struggle is an inherent part of life. Be selective about the things you invest your time and energy in, and make sure they are worth the challenges they bring.
- Let go of external validation:
    - Stop seeking approval and validation from others. Focus on developing your self-worth and deriving satisfaction from within, rather than relying on external sources.
- Embrace failure and learn from it:
    - Instead of avoiding failure, see it as a valuable learning opportunity. Embrace the lessons that failure can teach you and use them to grow and improve.
- Set boundaries:
    - Learn to say `no` to things that don't align with your values or goals. Establish healthy boundaries to protect your time, energy, and emotional well-being.
- Accept the inevitability of pain:
    - Understand that pain and suffering are part of the human experience. Rather than avoiding or suppressing them, embrace them as opportunities for growth and learning.
- Focus on the present moment:
    - Shift your attention to the present instead of dwelling on the past or worrying excessively about the future. Practice mindfulness and engage fully in what you are doing right now.

## Recap

I think this book is quite interesting from the authorâ€™s perspective. And I personally read this book just because the title is quite interesting. Based on the book, you decide the path that you want to continue walking based on your core values. As you walk on the path, there will be many doors (struggles) for you to decide on which door to open and you won't know what is it on the other side. If you failed, that is all right, and learn from it. There will be many failures either way.

From this book, two lessons I grasped are the significance of `let go of external validation` and `set boundaries`. In an era dominated by social media, there exists a pervasive pressure to emulate influencers and conform to their ideals. However, it is crucial to recognize that people follow them for their distinctiveness. Embracing your own uniqueness is important. While there may be numerous tasks vying for your attention, it is essential to say `no` and decline those that do not align with your core values.

That being says, if you crave something distinct and a refreshing outlook on personal growth and happiness, while also being open to questioning societal norms and cultural expectations, then this book is for you.
