## What is **the 'cd' Command**?

The `cd` command, an abbreviation for _change directory_, holds a distinguished position as one of the most fundamental and frequently employed commands in the Linux ecosystem. It serves as the primary means for traversing the intricate directory structure of the Linux file system.

## How Does it Work?

```bash
cd [Directory]
```

Directory represents the destination directory you want to navigate to. You can specify either an absolute path or a relative path

- **Absolute Path:** An absolute path starts from the root directory ('/') and specifies the full directory hierarchy leading to the target directory.
- **Relative Path:** A relative path, on the other hand, is specified relative to your current working directory.

### Moving to a Specific **Directory**

```bash
cd ~/Documents
```

### Navigating Up One **Directory Level**

```bash
cd ..
```

### Navigating to the Root **Directory**

```bash
cd /
```

### Returning to the Previous **Directory**

Let's illustrate this with an example:

- Suppose you start in your home directory (/home/user).
- You navigate to the _Documents_ directory:

```bash
cd Documents
# Now you're in /home/user/Documents
```

- Then, you decide to move to another directory, let's say _dev_:

```bash
cd dev
# Now you're in /home/user/Documents/dev
```

- If you want to return to the _previous_ directory which is the _Documents_ directory in this case, you can use the `cd -` command:

```bash
cd -
```
