## Monthly Reflection

June is here, marking the halfway point of the year and highlighting how time flies. üïäÔ∏è

### School!

I've committed to pursuing a degree! I am studying software development at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology. This new journey has been both exciting and challenging. In May, I focused on developing a planning system to organize my schedule, which is why I skipped the May reflection. Now, I am balancing classes, homework, self-directed learning, and personal time. Using insights from the book ‚ÄúMake Time,‚Äù my gaol is to maintain a good balance between these tasks with an effective planning system.

### A Planning System

For the past few weeks, I've been using Google Calendar and Tasks, finding them simpler and more manageable for organizing my schedule. Each week, I organize my tasks, giving me a clear view of what's ahead. I prioritize based on school assignments and self-directed learning, and I consciously allocate time for personal activities to prevent burnout. Having experienced burnout in the past, I know how draining it can be. I‚Äôm determined to avoid it by scheduling activities that I genuinely enjoy and find interesting. This approach not only keeps me productive but also ensures a healthy balance between school and personal life.

Reflecting on my journey so far, I've realized the importance of flexibility and adaptability. Life can be unpredictable, and sometimes, plans need to be adjusted. Embracing this mindset has helped me stay resilient and focused on my goals. As I continue my studies, I aim to remain open to new learning opportunities and challenges.

## Books

I've started setting aside a specific time each day for reading. It's taking time, but I'm steadily making reading a part of my daily routine.

- **The Miracle Morning**:
    - This book advocates for transforming your life by starting a powerful morning ritual. Rituals are meditation, exercise, reading, and affirmations to boost productivity and well-being.

    - This book focuses on productivity and mindfulness. It gives you a framework to take back control of your time and attention, even with distractions. It highlights making daily routines that prioritize meaningful work and personal growth.
- **Version Control with Git**:
    - This book is a practical guide to using Git, a widely used version control system. It covers key concepts such as repositories, branches, commits, and merging. It empowers developers to manage and collaborate on software projects effectively.
