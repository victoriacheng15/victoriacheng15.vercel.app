## What are the gzip and gunzip Commands in Linux?

The `gzip` and `gunzip` commands are used for compressing and decompressing files, respectively. `gzip` is commonly used to reduce the size of files for storage or transfer, while `gunzip` is used to extract files compressed by `gzip`.

Basic Syntax:

- gzip:

```bash
gzip [option] [file]
```

- gunzip:

```bash
gunzip [option] [file]
```

## Options

- Options for `gzip`

| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -d     | Decompress the file (same as using `gunzip`)                                   |
| -c     | Write output to standard output (stdout) and keep the original files unchanged |
| -k     | Keep the original files after compression                                      |

| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -c     | Write output to standard output (stdout) and keep the original files unchanged |
| -f     | Force decompression, even if the file appears to be corrupted                  |
| -l     | List the contents of the compressed file                                       |
