## Monthly Reflection

This month has felt like a mini-vacation for me. I’ve intentionally slowed down my pace to avoid rushing and burning out. By taking things slower, I’m able to notice more and appreciate the little things, which is especially refreshing in our fast-paced digital world. Everything seems to move so quickly that it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. I’ve also been reading books at a slower pace, which helps me absorb the content more deeply and enjoy the process. This slower approach allows me to reflect, make steady progress, and avoid feeling like I’m missing out. It’s been a great way to balance productivity with self-care, offering a break from the constant rush and helping me stay grounded.

### The secret to finding your ideal workplace

In this TED Talk, Marion highlights the importance of evaluating company culture when choosing between job offers. Instead of focusing solely on salary, title, or projects, she advises selecting a job based on cultural fit. Marion suggests two key methods for assessing a company’s culture before accepting an offer:

- **Observe the Recruitment Process**: How the company interacts with you during recruitment. A slow response or a hierarchical interview process can indicate a company’s pace and culture.
- **Ask Key Questions**: During interviews, ask these three crucial questions:
    - What **kind of people** get promoted here? 
      - This reveals whether the company values merit, tenure, or other factors.
    - What are your **core values**? 
      - Understanding core values helps determine if they align with your principles.
    - When was the last time you received **feedback** here? 
      - This shows how the company handles feedback and supports employee growth.

It's easy to get caught up in job titles, salary, or cool projects, but those shouldn't be your only focus. The three questions from the talk are super useful for digging into a company's culture. They'll help you see how the company handles promotions, what its core values are, and how it deals with feedback. This info can help you find a place that fits your values and growth goals.

In the end, it’s all about what you want for your career and what’s most important to you. Asking the right questions about company culture can help you pick a job that aligns with your personal and professional goals.
