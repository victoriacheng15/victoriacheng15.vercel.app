## What is cp command in Linux?

At its core, _cp_ stands for _copy_. It is a command-line utility that allows users to make copies of files and directories. Wehther you are duplicating important documents, backing up crucial data, or simply organizing your files. Let's explore its functionality and various options.

## Understanding the Basics

Executing the `cp` command without any options simply copies a file or directory from one location to another.

```bash
cp source_file destination_file
```

## Options

### -r

The **recursive** option allows copying entire directories and their contents recursively.

```bash
cp -r source_file destination_file
```

### -i

The **interactive** option prompts the user for confirmation before overwriting existing files.

```bash
cp -i source_file destination_file
```

### -v

The **verbose** option displays detailed information about each file being copied, providing feedback on the operation's progress.

```bash
cp -v source_file destination_file
```

### -u

The **update** option copies only when the source file is newer than the destination file or when the destination file is missing.

```bash
cp -u source_file destination_file
```

### -p

The **preserve** option retains the original file attributes, such as permissions, timestamps, and ownership, when copying files.

```bash
cp -p source_file destination_file
```

### -l

The **link** option creates hard links instead of copying the file itself, saving disk space by referencing the same data.

```bash
cp -l source_file destination_file
```

### -s

The **symbolic link** option creates symbolic links (symlinks) instead of copying the file, providing a lightweight reference to the original file.

```bash
cp -s source_file destination_file
```

### -b

The **backup** option creates backups of existing destination files before overwriting them, helping prevent accidental data loss.

```bash
cp -b source_file destination_file
```

Additionally, to delve even deeper into the functionality of each option, you can explore further by using the respective command followed by:

```bash
cp --help
# or
# consulting the manual pages
man cp
```

These commands provide comprehensive documentation and explanations for each option
