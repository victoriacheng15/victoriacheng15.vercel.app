## What is a Python Set?

A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. This means that sets do not allow duplicate elements, and the order of elements is not guaranteed. Sets are defined using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` .

Sets are useful when dealing with scenarios where _uniqueness_ matters, such as removing duplicates from a list or checking for membership efficiently.

```python
# Creating a set using curly braces {}
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Creating a set using set() function
another_set = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```

## How do Sets Work?

Internally, Python sets are implemented using a data structure called a hash table, which allows for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions. When you add an element to a set, Python calculates the hash value of the element and stores it in a way that allows for quick retrieval. This makes operations like checking membership or performing set operations (such as union, intersection, and difference) very efficient, even for large sets.

## Set Methods:

After understanding how sets work, let's explore some of the common methods available for manipulating sets:

### `add()`:

- Adds an element to the set.

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3}

my_set.add(4)
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
```

### `clear()`:

- Removes all elements from the set.

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}

my_set.clear()
print(my_set)  # Output: set()
```

### `copy()`:

- Return a copy of the set

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3}

copied_set = my_set.copy()
print(copied_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}
```

### `difference() vs difference_update()`

- `difference()`: Returns a new set containing elements that are present in the first set but not in the second set. It does _not modify the original set_, but rather returns a new set with the elements that are unique to the first set.
- `difference_updat()`: Removes the items in this set that are also included in another, specified set. This method _modifies the original set_ by removing the elements that are common to both sets.

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}

# Using difference() method
difference_result = set1.difference(set2)
print("Using difference() method:", difference_result)  
# Output: {1, 2}
print("Original set1 after difference():", set1)  
# 👉 Output: {1, 2, 3} (unchanged)

# Using difference_update() method
set1.difference_update(set2)
print("Original set1 after difference_update()", set1)  
# 👉 Output: {1, 2}
```

### `discard()`:

- Removes a specified element from the set if it is present.

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}

my_set.discard(2)
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 3, 4}
```

### `intersection()` vs `intersection_update()`:

- `intersection()`: Returns a new set containing elements that are present in both sets. It does _not modify the original sets_, but rather returns a new set with elements that are common to both sets.
- `intersection_update()`: _Modifies the original set_ by removing the elements that are not present in the specified set(s). After the operation, the original set will only contain elements that are common to both the original set and the specified set(s).

```python
# Using intersection() method
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}

intersection_result = set1.intersection(set2)
print("Using intersection() method:", intersection_result)  
# Output: {3}
print("Original set1 after intersection():", set1)  
# 👉 Output: {1, 2, 3} (unchanged)

# Using intersection_update() method
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}

set1.intersection_update(set2)
print("Original set1 after intersection_update():", set1)  
# 👉 Output: {3}
```

### `isdisjoint()`:

- Returns True if there are no common elements between two sets, indicating that their intersection is empty.

```python
# No common elements
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {4, 5, 6}

print(set1.isdisjoint(set2))  # Output: True

# Have one common element
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {4, 5, 6}

print(set1.isdisjoint(set2))  # Output: False
```

### `issubset()`:

- Returns True if all elements of the set are present in another specified set.

```python
set1 = {1, 2}
set2 = {1, 2, 3, 4}

print(set1.issubset(set2))  # Output: True

# =====================================
set1 = {1, 2, 5}
set2 = {1, 2, 3, 4}

print(set1.issubset(set2))  # Output: False
```

### `issuperset()`:

- Returns True if all elements of another specified set are present in this set.

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {1, 2}

print(set1.issuperset(set2))  # Output: True

# =====================================
set1 = {1, 2}
set2 = {1, 2, 3, 4}

print(set1.issuperset(set2))  # Output: False
```

### `pop()`:

- Removes and returns an arbitrary element from the set.

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}

popped_element = my_set.pop()
print("Popped element:", popped_element) # Popped element: 1
print("Set after popping:", my_set) #S et after popping: {2, 3, 4}
```

### `remove()`:

- Removes a specified element from the set.

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}

my_set.remove(3)
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 4}
```

### `symmetric_difference()` vs `symmetric_difference_update()`:

- `symmetric_difference()`:  Returns a new set containing elements that are present in either of the sets, but not in both. It does _not modify the original sets_ but rather returns a new set with elements that are unique to each set.
- `symmetric_difference_update()`: _Modifies the original_ set by inserting the symmetric differences from this set and another set.

```python
# Using symmetric_difference()
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}

symmetric_difference_result = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)
print("Using symmetric_difference() method:", symmetric_difference_result)  
# Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}
print("Original set1 after symmetric_difference():", set1)  
# 👉 Output: {1, 2, 3} (unchanged)

# Using symmetric_difference_update()
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}

set1.symmetric_difference_update(set2)
print("Original set1 after symmetric_difference_update():", set1)  
# 👉 Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}

```

### `union()`:

- Returns a new set containing all unique elements from both sets.

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}

union_result = set1.union(set2)
print(union_result)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

### `update()`:

- Update the set with the union of this set and others

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}

set1.update(set2)
print(set1)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```
