## What is the sort Command in Linux?

The `sort` command in Linux is a powerful utility that sorts the lines of text files or standard input and outputs the sorted lines. It is commonly used to organize data in alphabetical, numerical, or reverse order, making it easier to analyze and process.

Basic syntax:

```bash
sort [option] [file]
```

Sort a file alphabetically:

```bash
sort file-name
```

## Options

|  -d, --dictionary-order  | Consider only blanks and alphanumeric characters |
| -f, --ignore-case | Fold lower case to upper case characters |
| -n, --numeric-sort | Compare according to string numerical value |
| -r, --reverse | reverse the result of comparisons |
