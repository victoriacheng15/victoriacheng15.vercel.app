## What is the Steal Like An Artist book?

This book written by Austin Kleon is a compelling and insightful book that challenges traditional notions of creativity. Published in 2012, this concise yet impactful guide offers a fresh perspective on the creative process, encouraging readers to embrace influence, remix ideas, and liberate their creativity. Kleon argues that nothing is truly original and that all artists build upon existing ideas to create something new.

## Ideas:

1. Steal Like an Artist:
   - Exploring the concept that all creative work is inspired by and builds upon existing ideas.

   - Encouraging readers to begin their creative journey without waiting for a fully formed identity.
3. Write the Book You Want to Read:
   - Emphasizing the importance of creating work that you find meaningful and enjoyable.
4. Use Your Hands:
   - Advocating for the value of hands-on, tactile creative processes.
5. Side Projects and Hobbies Are Important:
   - Highlighting the benefits of engaging in side projects and hobbies to enhance creativity.
6. The Secret: Do Good Work and Share It with People:
   - Stressing the significance of producing quality work and sharing it generously with others.
7. Geography Is No Longer Our Master:
   - Discussing how the digital age has removed geographical barriers for creative individuals.

9. Be Boring (It's the Only Way to Get Work Done):
   - Encouraging the establishment of routines and habits to foster a consistent and productive creative practice.

    - Emphasizing the concept that creativity often involves knowing what to leave out, simplifying ideas, and focusing on the essential elements of your work. Subtraction can lead to more impactful and meaningful creations.

## Recap

Kleon's writing is straightforward and relatableâ€”no fancy language, just genuine talk and relatable stories. He rejects the idea of needing a perfect plan, encouraging you to dive in, create, and let your style develop naturally. The book has ten short, impactful chapters, each offering practical advice. Kleon promotes hands-on creativity, from doodling to crafting, as a powerful tool to overcome creative hurdles.

A key idea is 'stealing,' not in a suspicious way, but recognizing that every artist is influenced by others. Kleon celebrates the art of remixing, putting your spin on existing ideas, and making them your own.

This book is for those who want to play the creativity game, not stealing in a shady way, but for those eager to explore diverse ideas and inspirations. It's perfect if you're working on something and need a fresh perspective or a spark of creativity.
