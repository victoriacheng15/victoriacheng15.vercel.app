## Monthly Reflection

In mid-February, I cooked up this little app called "Articles Extractor." It smoothly grabs articles from freeCodeCamp and Substack, then neatly drops them into a Google Sheets spot for easy consolidation. Currently, the app resides on the Raspberry Pi and runs on a daily basis with cron schedule!

This got me pondering about using Python for my daily journal entries in Google Sheets.  Initially, I started with a Google Form, and the setup made sorting data a real headache ðŸ˜±. On the hunt for a fix, I dabbled with Google Sheets' `arrayFormula` to split the data. It did the trick by processing a whole column ,whether the row is empty or not, splitting cell data into lines with a specific word. However, it threw in some readability issues with all those empty spaces across rows.

After experimenting with pivot tables to sort out extracted article data, I thought of an efficient approach on how to sort journal data. This led me to redesign the journal data entry processâ€”out with the Google Form, and in with using the terminal for journal inputs (ideally, one input equals one row), and finally, sending the entry to the Sheets. Now, I can easily sort entries based on categories with pivot tables.

In the next phase of my little project, I went deep into setting up a script for dropping my categorized journal bits into the sheets. It's super handy since I practically live with the terminal open, and even when I'm away from the computer, I can easily write down data on my phone ðŸ“±. 

And here's a bonus discovery, Makefile is awesome! It allows you to set up commands, like "make journal" for sending journal data after gathered inputs. I can see this approach making it easier for other ideas to come to life. Excited to see how these ideas shape up! ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ˜€
