## Monthly Reflection

> Worry does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow. It emptyies today of its strength. By Corrie Ten Boom

At certain points in our lives, we often find ourselves consumed by worry and gripped by anxiety, whether for valid reasons or seemingly trivial ones. This is an inevitable aspect of the human experience. To think more on this, it begs the question: why we invest our precious time and energy in matters over which we have no control? This places a heavy burden on our mental and emotional reserves, leaving us depleted by day‚Äôs end. Let‚Äôs shift our attention towards the positivity that illuminate our path and focus on what we can conrol.

Moreover. if something has already hapened, let us leave it behind in the past, but not without first learning from it to improve ourselves for the future.
