## Monthly Reflection

This month, I read _The Strangest Secret_ by Earl Nightingale, and I feel it’s a great fit for my reflection post. This self-help classic has stood the test of time. The main idea is simple: “We become what we think about.” Nightingale shows how our thoughts can help us reach our goals or hold us back, depending on how we focus on them. The book emphasizes setting clear goals, maintaining a positive mindset, and staying disciplined in everything we do. Even though it was written decades ago, the advice still resonates today.

Here are five key takeaways from the book:

- **We become what we think about**: What you think about most is what you’ll become.
- **Success is a journey**: Success isn’t a final destination; it’s the process of moving toward your goals.
- **Set clear goals**: You can’t achieve success without knowing what you're aiming for.
- **Gratitude and positivity matter**: The more grateful and positive you are, the more good things tend to come your way.
- **Discipline is key**: Consistent effort and sticking with it are non-negotiable for success.

The idea that _“we become what we think about”_ really sticks with me. Once you have a clear vision of what you want for your future, your thoughts and actions align with that. By setting specific goals and creating a plan, you begin taking real steps toward the future you've imagined. It’s a reminder that success isn’t a final destination—it’s just a sign you’re making progress. Each small win proves that you’re moving closer to the life you want.

It’s also important to stay positive along the way. Sometimes things won’t go the way you expected, but instead of seeing that as a failure, think of it as a detour. Even if you get off course, you can always find your way back to the path you're on and keep moving forward.

If you’re unsure or uncertain about what to do in the future, I think this book would be a great resource for you. Take some time to sit down and think about what you truly want to achieve. Clarifying your goals can help guide your path and give you the direction you need.

## Books I’ve Read

- **The Millionaire Fastlane**
  - MJ DeMarco challenges conventional wealth-building advice, arguing that the traditional path of saving and investing is slow and often ineffective. He introduces the "Fastlane," a mindset focused on entrepreneurship, innovation, and leveraging one's time and skills to create scalable income. By taking calculated risks and prioritizing speed over security, individuals can achieve financial freedom much faster than the slow lane offers.
- **Range Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World**
  - David Epstein explores the advantages of being a generalist in a society that often values specialization. He argues that diverse experiences and interdisciplinary knowledge lead to greater creativity, problem-solving, and adaptability. Through various examples—from sports to business—Epstein shows how breadth of experience can lead to success in complex, unpredictable environments where specialists may struggle.
- **The Strangest Secret: How to Live the Life You Desire**
  - Earl Nightingale's classic emphasizes the power of thought and goal-setting. His key message is that "we become what we think about," encouraging readers to define their goals clearly. Nightingale stresses that success is a journey, not a destination, and highlights the importance of self-discipline, gratitude, and maintaining a positive mindset. By focusing on goals and thinking positively, anyone can achieve the life they desire.
