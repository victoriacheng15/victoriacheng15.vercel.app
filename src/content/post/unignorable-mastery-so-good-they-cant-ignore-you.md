## What is the So Good They Can’t Ignore You book?

It is a book by Cal Newport that challenges the conventional career advice of following your passion. Instead, it advocates developing rare and valuable skills, building career capital, and creating work that you love through deliberate practice. The book argues that the true path to work you love lies in becoming a craftsman of the work you already have, collecting rare skills, and taking control of your hours in the process. It also suggests that fulfilling careers are built by analyzing what matters.

## The 4 rules

Here are the 4 rules that the author suggests in his book:

- Don’t follow your passion:
  - The advice to follow your passion is flawed and it is more important to develop rare and valuable skills.
- Develop rare and valuable skills:
  - The key to a fulfilling career is becoming a craftsman of the work you already have, collecting rare skills, and taking control of your hours in the process.
- Turn down a promotion (the importance of control):
  - Once you have developed rare and valuable skills, you can use them to gain more control over your work and life.
- Think small, act big (the importance of mission):
  - Once you have developed rare and valuable skills and gained more control over your work and life, you can use your skills to make a positive impact on the world.

## Recap

I find this book fascinating as it encourages the readers to reconsider the idea of solely pursuing one’s passion. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of developing unique and valuable skills. Ultimately. possessing rare and valuable skills enables you to leverage them to your advantage, rather than solely benefiting the company or others.

Delving into the author’s insights on becoming indispensable is enlightening. Personally, I advocate for a customizable approach to this journey. Stay flexible in your pursuits, adapting to your needs. Tailor your path, whether aligning skill development with your passion or pursuing your chosen path irrespective of passion. In the end, the choice is yours!
