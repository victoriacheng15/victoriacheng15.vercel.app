## What is the Miracle Morning book?

Hal Elrod's _The Miracle Morning_ demonstrates how a morning routine centered around six key practices—Silence, Affirmations, Visualization, Exercise, Reading, and Scribing (the SAVERS)—can help you accomplish more and live your best life.

## My experience

haven't tried every aspect of SAVERS or SLUMBERS simply because I haven't found the need to explore all of them yet. For me, the biggest challenge has been going to sleep early. I've noticed that when I struggle with this, it’s often because negative thoughts are swirling in my mind. This book has introduced me to a powerful method to truly release stressful feelings: bringing them from my unconscious to my conscious mind, acknowledging them, processing them, and then letting them go.

Here’s a simple exercise from the book that I find incredibly helpful:

> I am feeling \***\*\_\_\_\*\*** [fear, anxiety, anger, stress, sadness, frustration, or any other sleep-disrupting emotion] about \***\*\_\_\_\*\*** [insert the perceived cause of your inner turmoil].

Filling in these blanks has been a game-changer for me. It is like shining a light on these hidden worries and watching them shrink.

When it comes to reading, I've discovered that reading just 10 pages each day is incredibly beneficial. Let's do the math: in a year with 365 days, reading 10 pages a day adds up to 3650 pages per year. That’s a lot of books and a lot of new knowledge!

Finally, the book emphasizes the importance of focusing only on what you can control. This mindset shift has been crucial for me. It's amazing how much more manageable stress becomes when you let go of things outside your control and concentrate on what you can actually influence. It’s not just a method; it’s a way to enhance your overall well-being.
