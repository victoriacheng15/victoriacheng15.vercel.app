## What is Show Your Work?

The book “Show Your Work” by Austin Kleon is a guide for creators navigating self-promotion in the digital age. It promotes transparency, urging individuals to openly share their creative process and victories. The goal is to gain visibility, connect with like-minded individuals, and contribute meaningfully to creative communities. Through ten principles, the book empowers readers to share, teach, and network effectively, fostering a fulfilling creative experience in the era of social media.

## 10 Ways:

1. Share Something Small Every Day:
   - Consistently share bits of your creative process. It doesn't have to be a masterpiece; small, regular updates can engage your audience.
2. Think Process, Not Product:
   - Highlight the journey, not just the final outcome. Share the steps, challenges, and discoveries involved in your creative projects.
3. Become a Documentarian of What You Do:
   - Keep a record of your work, thoughts, and inspirations. Documenting your creative process provides valuable content for sharing.
4. Share Useful Content:
   - Offer valuable information, tips, or resources related to your field. This helps others and establishes you as a helpful figure in your community.
5. Teach What You Know:
   - Share your knowledge and skills. Teaching is a powerful way to solidify your understanding and connect with others who are interested in your work.
6. Use Social Media Wisely:
   - Be strategic about your online presence. Utilize social media platforms to showcase your work and connect with like-minded individuals.
7. Network:
   - Connect with people in your field or related areas. Building relationships can lead to collaborations, opportunities, and a broader audience for your work.
8. Become Findable:
   - Make it easy for others to discover your work. Use online platforms, tags, and keywords effectively to increase your visibility.
9. Share Your Trade Secrets:
   - Don't be afraid to share insights into your process or industry. Being transparent about your methods can foster a sense of community and trust.
10. Don't Turn into Human Spam:
    - Balance self-promotion with genuine engagement. Avoid overwhelming your audience with constant promotional content.

## Recap

This book introduces ten empowering principles to effortlessly showcase your work. I'm particularly drawn to the idea of "becoming a documentarian of what you do." This principle encourages recording not just the work but also your thoughts and inspirations. This documentation serves as a precious resource, offering a retrospective view of your achievements. It becomes an invaluable aid for your weekly, monthly, and yearly reflections, especially considering that our minds can't recall everything, and important details may fade over time. This practice helps prevent forgetting significant insights and ensures a comprehensive record of your creative journey.

If you seek a framework for showcasing work in the digital era, this book is invaluable, providing practical principles to navigate the challenges of online self-promotion, applicable to anyone in any field.
