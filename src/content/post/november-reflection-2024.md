## Monthly Reflection

It’s the last month of the year, and 2024 is quickly coming to a close! It’s not quite time to look back on everything just yet, but it’s a clear reminder that 2025 is right around the corner. December brings that unmistakable sense of nearing the finish line, a gentle nudge to wrap up the year strong and prepare for what’s to come in just a few short weeks.”

I recently discovered that Google made an amazing update to Docs. They introduced document tabs, so you can now have one file with multiple tabs. I thought this was a fantastic change because it lets me organize my journals or files by title and categorize content within tabs. This idea seemed perfect for journals, so I decided to try it out and have been using it since the middle of October.

Since I started using the new document tabs feature, I’ve organized my journal into sections with a to-do list for the day and three categories: **Daily**, **Books**, and **Today I Learn**. This setup helps me track what I need to do for the day, write down what’s happening (like things I’ve learned or feelings I’ve had), and note something interesting from the books I’m reading. It’s been really helpful for staying organized and reflecting on my day.

Now, I can arrange my journal by year and month, with tabs for each day. There’s no need to keep multiple files in a folder anymore. Another great thing about document tabs is that I can view all my journals for the month in a single browser tab. I don’t have to open multiple tabs in Chrome anymore.

While I didn’t write a reflection for October, I spent that time refining my journaling system. I think the current format is a great match for what I need right now, and it should work well unless things change in the future.

## Books I’ve Read

- **Fundamentals of Software Architecture:**
    - A practical guide to designing effective software systems. It covers key topics like architectural styles, trade-offs, decision-making, and adaptability. Emphasizing both technical and leadership skills, it equips architects to align designs with business goals, manage complexity, and embrace continuous evolution
