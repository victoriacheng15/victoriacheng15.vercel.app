## What is the cut Command in Linux?

The `cut` command is used to extract sections from each line of files or standard input. It allows you to cut out specific fields or characters from text, which is useful for processing and analyzing data. It is often employed in shell scripts or command-line operations to manipulate text data efficiently.

Basic syntax:

```bash
cut [option] [file]
```

Example:

```bash
cut -d ',' -f 1,3 file-name
```
