## What is useRef?

The `useRef` hook in React is tailored for working with DOM elements and mutable values within functional components. Its key advantage is that it avoids unnecessary re-renders, boosting performance.

A major use case for `useRef` is obtaining direct references to DOM elements, which is useful for imperative operations like focusing inputs or working with external libraries. It also stores values across renders without causing re-renders, serving as a lightweight alternative to the useState.

```jsx
const ref = useRef(initialValue);

// examples
const counts = useRef(0);
const myValue = useRef(null);
```

## The difference between with and without useRef

- without useRef - when clicking the button, the console will show 2 messages, `You clicked x times!` and `re-rendering`
- with useRef - - when clicking the button, the console will show 1 message, `You clicked x times!` only

## Example code

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from "react";

export default function App() {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

	function handleClick() {
		setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
		console.log(`You clicked ${count} times!`);
	}

	useEffect(() => {
		console.log("re-rendering");
	}, [count]);

	// let ref = useRef(0);

	// function handleClick() {
	// 	ref.current++;
	// 	console.log(`You clicked ${ref.current} times!`);
	// }

	// useEffect(() => {
	// 	console.log("re-rendering")
	// }, [ref])

	return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me!</button>;
}
```

## Recap

The `useRef` hook is a tool in React for managing mutable values and interacting with the DOM within functional components. It shares similarities with `useCallback` and `useMemo` in that it prevents unnecessary re-renders, contributing to better performance.
