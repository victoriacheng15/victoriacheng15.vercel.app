## What are the head and tail Commands in Linux?

The `head` and `tail` commands are used to display the **beginning** and **end** sections of a file, respectively. These commands are useful for quickly viewing the contents of a file without opening it in an editor.

Basic Syntax:

By default, both commands will display the **first** or **last** 10 lines of file contents respectively.

- head:

```bash
head [option] [file]
```

- tail:

```bash
tail [option] [file]
```

## Options

| -q, --quiet, --silent | Never print headers giving file names |
| -v, --verbose | Always print headers giving file names |
