## Monthly Reflection

This month, my routine deviated from the usual, and I am still in the process of returning to the familiar pattern I had before my trip abroad. Additionally, urgent matters last week disrupted my daily routine. While it might signal the need for something new, it doesn't have to be entirely different. Life involves consistent adjustmentsâ€”events occur, and the old route may no longer seem as appealing. It's a good time to incorporate a slightly new but not entirely different route to keep moving forward. ðŸ’ª

I introduced a Google Form to document my daily journal entries, capturing insights from software development, books, articles, and more. The form automatically sends my submissions to an Excel sheet, where I organize and categorize the data. While this approach allows me to centralize all information in one place, I have noticed a couple of issues. There were instances where I didn't articulate my entries clearly, and upon later review, I struggled to recognize what I had done or learned. ðŸ˜… This is an area I need to focus on and improve in the coming month.

One crucial aspect I want to emphasize about failure is that it is an inherent part of the journey. While persevering through setbacks can be challenging, it's essential not to view them as failures but rather to adopt the mindset of someone like Thomas Edison!
