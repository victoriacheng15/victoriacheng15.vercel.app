## Recap

I value the principles of "forget the noun, do the verb," "plant your garden," and "you are allowed to change your mind." "Forget the noun, do the verb" aligns with proactive ideals from "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People," emphasizing action to validate words. "Plant your garden" metaphorically underscores the need for planning and commitment to success. With a clear plan and goal, the metaphorical garden can thrive. "You are allowed to change your mind" stresses the importance of flexibility; adapting decisions is crucial, especially when Plan A falls short.
