## What is the grep Command in Linux?

The `grep` command is your go-to tool for searching through files to find lines that match a specific pattern. Whether you're hunting for a string in a log file or looking for particular content in a large dataset, `grep` can help you locate it quickly.

Basic syntax:

```bash
grep [options] pattern file.txt
```

## Options

| Option                   | Description                                                                                               |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| -i, --ignore-case        | Makes the search case-insensitive, so it matches patterns regardless of upper or lower case               |
| -v, --invert-match       | Shows lines that do not match the pattern, effectively inverting the search                               |
| -r, --recursive          | Searches through directories and subdirectories, looking inside each file                                 |
| -l, --files-with-matches | Lists just the filenames of files that contain matches, rather than the matches themselves                |
| -n, --line-number        | Shows the line number along with the matching lines, so you know where each match is                      |
| -H, --with-filename      | Displays the filename before each match, useful when searching through multiple files                     |
| -h, --no-filename        | Suppresses the filename in the output (default if only one file is searched)                              |
| -o, --only-matching      | Shows only the parts of the line that match the pattern, with each match on its own line                  |
| -c, --count              | Counts the number of matches in each file and prints the total, without showing the actual matching lines |
| -w, --word-regexp        | Searches for matches that are whole words, so partial matches within words are ignored                    |
