## What is mkdir?

`mkdir` stands for "make directory". It is a command-line utility in Unix and Unix-like operating systems used to create directories (folders) within the file system.

## How to use `mkdir` with examples:

- Creating one directory:

```bash
mkdir directory1
```

You can you use `-v` option to make `mkdir` more verbose, showing each directory as it is created.

```bash
mkdir -v directory1
# created directory 'directory1'
```

If you want to create a directory name like `my awesome directory`

```bash
mkdir "my awesome directory"
```

- Creating more than one directories:

```bash
mkdir directory1 directory2 directory3

```

- Creating nested directories

You can create directories with in directories with the `-p` or `-parents` option.

```bash
mkdir -p parent_directory/child_directory
```

Additionally, you can use the `man` command to view detailed information about `mkdir` and its various options.

man mkdir
```
