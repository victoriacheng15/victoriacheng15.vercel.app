## What is the uniq Command in Linux?

The `uniq` command in Linux is a useful utility that filters out or reports repeated lines in a file or standard input. It's typically used to identify or remove duplicate lines, making it easier to manage and analyze data that might contain redundant entries.

Basic syntax:

```bash
uniq [option] [input-file] [output-file]
```

Sort a file alphabetically:

```bash
uniq file-name
```

## Options

| Option | Description                                             |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| -c     | Precede each output line with the number of occurrences |
| -d     | Only print duplicate lines, one for each group          |
| -u     | Only print unique lines                                 |
| -i     | Ignore differences in case when comparing               |
| -w N   | Compare no more than N characters in a line             |
