## What is a Python Loop?

In Python, loops are essential constructs that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. There are different types of loops available, each with its own purpose and usage. Let's explore how loops work in Python and provide examples of using them with lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

```python
for i in range(5):
	print(i)

"""
Output:
0
1
2
3
4
"""
```

## The for Loop:

The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence of elements such as lists, tuples, sets, or dictionaries. It executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.

### Looping Through a List

```python
fruits_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits_list:
    print(fruit)

"""
Output:
apple
banana
cherry
"""
```

### Looping Through a Tuple

```python
fruits_tuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

for fruit in fruits_tuple:
    print(fruit)

"""
Output:
apple
banana
cherry
"""
```

### Looping Through a Set

```python
fruits_set = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
for fruit in fruits_set:
    print(fruit)

"""
Output:
apple
banana
cherry
"""
```

### Looping Through a Dictionary

```python
fruits_dict = {"apple": "red", "banana": "yellow", "cherry": "red"}
```

- With `items()`

```python
for key, value in fruits_dict.items():
    print(f"{key} is {value}")

"""
Output:
apple is red
banana is yellow
cherry is red
"""
```

- With `keys()`

```python
for key in fruits_dict.keys():
    print(f"Fruit key: {key}")

"""
Output:
Fruit key: apple
Fruit key: banana
Fruit key: cherry
"""
```

- With `values()`

```python
for value in fruits_dict.values():
    print(f"Fruit value: {value}")

"""
Output:
Fruit Values: red
Fruit Values: yellow
Fruit Values: red
"""
```

## The while Loop:

The `while` loop in Python repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. It's particularly useful when the number of iterations is unknown beforehand.

### Basic Example

This code demonstrates the usage of a while loop with both lists and tuples.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# Uncomment this to see tuple example
# fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

index = 0
while index < len(fruits):
  item = fruits[index]
  print(f"At index {index} is {item}")
  index += 1

"""
Output:
At index 0 is apple
At index 1 is banana
At index 2 is cherry
"""
```

### Dictionary Example:

Lets say if you want to loop through a dictionary, there are extra steps to setup first

```python
fruits_dict = {"apple": "red", "banana": "yellow", "cherry": "red"}

keys = list(fruits_dict.keys())  # Get the keys as a list
index = 0  # Initialize index
while index < len(keys):
    key = keys[index]
    print(f"index: {index}, key: {key}")
    index += 1

"""
Output:
index: 0, key: apple
index: 1, key: banana
index: 2, key: cherry
"""
```

## Loop Control Statements:

Python provides loop control statements such as `break`, `continue`, and `else` to control the flow of the loop.

### Break Example

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for item in fruits:
    if item == "banana":
        print("Found banana! Exiting loop.")
        break
"""
Output:
Found banana! Exiting loop.
"""
```

### Continue Example

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for item in fruits:
    if item == "banana":
        print("Skipping banana...")
        continue
    print(item)
"""
Output:
apple
Skipping banana...
cherry
"""
```

### Else Example

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for item in fruits:
    if item == "watermelon":
        print("Found a watermelon!")
        break
else:
    print("Watermelon is not found.")

"""
Output:
Watermelon is not found.
"""
```
